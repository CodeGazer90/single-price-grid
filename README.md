## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This project was a great refresher after taking a short break to focus on my Splunk internship.

I learned the importance of building out my frame first using flex grid and flex box and I also learned that it is much easier to build out the site working my way from top to bottom. Starting with the mobile version first also made it much easier to edit the small changes I later need for full screen viewing.


### Continued development

I would like to keep practicing with utilizing flex grid to build out my frames, it was very helpful.
